      <h4>A History Lesson</h4>
        <p class='article-author'>Isaac Easton</p>
      <p class='text'>The history of the University of Chicago is relatively short for an elite research institution, but the University’s history is crowded with new discoveries and academic innovation. While you’ve no doubt heard of achievements like the first sustained nuclear reaction and the high number of Nobel prize-winning economists, what’s truly astounding is how the University has equaled other institutions’ accomplishments and prestige in a fraction of the time.</p>
        <p class='text'>The University is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year, through its origins date back even further. In light of this anniversary the idiom “know your past so that you may build your future” is perhaps more applicable to this university than any other. Why? In contrast to peer institutions, which were founded as either entirely secular public land grant colleges or predominantly religious private seminaries, our university was founded as a German research institution with Baptist oil money. That meant religious funds for secular scholarship; a revolutionary concept. This, coupled with the many great minds that have passed through our grey citadel, has led to a history of ferocious debate about what a preeminent Midwestern institution should look like.</p>
        <p class='text'>Dean of the College John W. Boyer, in his newly published book, <em>The University of Chicago: A History</em>, breaks the history of the University’s administration into six distinct epochs. The history of the student body can perhaps be divided into five epochs—five distinct phases in which the culture of the University’s campus has adopted a specific tone. What has remained constant across all of these periods for the student body is, perhaps unsurprisingly, its intense academicism.</p>
        <p class='text'>So let’s start in the beginning. The first epoch was one of pure, hardcore academics at the “Old” University of Chicago. In 1857 Stephen A. Douglas, of Lincoln–Douglas debate fame, founded an institution called University of Chicago in what is now Brownsville. He created it as a Baptist institution to honor his dead wife. In this era a competitive intellectual culture was nothing short of rampant. Social life revolved around student oratorical contests. These contests were notoriously cutthroat, with one disgruntled senior going so far as to hold a trustee member at gunpoint for not giving him first place. Notwithstanding the vitality of these oratorical contests, the university could not keep itself afloat and shuttered its doors in 1886.</p>
        <p class='text'>In 1890, after much petitioning on the part of university trustees Thomas Goodspeed and Fredrick Gates, John D. Rockefeller donated the funds to create the new University of Chicago. The president was visionary William Rainey Harper, a serious scholar of the classical and semitic languages, who came to the University from a Baptist seminary by way of Yale. Although Rockefeller and others were determined to make this university a Baptist one, Harper decided to take a different route—following “the German model.” Historically, a German research institution is a place where knowledge is pursued for its own sake <em>and</em> where those pursuing it have the <em>freedom</em> to follow it to whatever conclusion.</p>
        <p class='text'>And thus we enter the second epoch of the University: the school spirit days. Notwithstanding Harper’s sobriety, he allowed and even encouraged social organizations like fraternities and sports teams to set up shop on campus. Harper went so far as to hope that if his son did join a Greek organization, that it would be “the Alpha Delts" (Bar Night has never meant so much). He also was a large supporter of the University’s football program, and became, in Robert Lester’s words, an “evangelist of the gridiron gospel.” He defended the coach, Amos Alonzo Stagg, from faculty members who wanted to see their students hitting the books instead of each other. The University of Chicago’s athleticism peaked long after Harper’s tenure came to a close, in 1935 when Jay Berwanger won the first Heismann Trophy.</p>
        <p class='text'>Six years before this momentous occasion, however,  the young Robert Maynard Hutchins was elected president of the University. At this point, we see the University enter its most radical phase. Almost immediately after Hutchins came into office he started making changes. He reorganized the University into four research divisions plus a college of liberal arts. He then implemented the “New Plan,” which would provide general education for all students and eliminate grades. (The New Plan evolved into our Core, but unfortunately the grades are back.)</p>
        <p class='text'>At the same time students became more ideologically left, inviting members of the Communist Party to speak on campus. Amos Alonzo Stagg also agreed to allow a socialist-sponsored Counter Olympics—the International Workers Athletic Meet—to be staged on the field bearing his name. Hutchins was compelled to defend both the students and Stagg from the attacks of angry alumni. In the late ’40s, Hutchins’ radical nature and his defense of the radicals on his campus set in motion an era of radicalism that lasted until the late ’60s. The most notable alumni of this era are famed organizing theorist Saul D. Alinsky and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.</p>
        <p class='text'>The next era is characterized by an intense, if not Spartan, emphasis on academics. Symbolically, this era is recognized by the building of the Regenstein Library on top of what was once Stagg Field. This was UChicago in the ’80s. People came to school here then because they really wanted to learn things. The depressed attitude that characterized this period at the school left alumni saying that although they received a first-rate education, they wouldn’t want to send their children here. Then College President Donald Levine responded to this by instituting now long-time University traditions like Kuvia and parents visiting weekend in the fall.</p>
        <p class='text'>Fast-forward a few more years and we are where we are at now. Dorm-building has resumed and satellite dorms are shuttered to center undergraduates on campus. The University is becoming increasingly preprofessional with an emphasis on expanding post-graduation opportunities for students. A new relationship with the city has allowed the University to launch large-scale projects in the surrounding neighborhoods. It’s an exciting time to be a UChicago student.</p>

You may have read the 2012 <i>New Yorker <a href='http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/the-hunter-games' target="_blank">article</a></i> profiling the hunt. You might have heard about how Scav officially took the Guinness World Record in 2011 for the world’s largest scavenger hunt. Depending on your team allegiance, which is typically comprised of houses banded together, Scav is either the Super Bowl of collective effervescence or a blip on your radar. Hard-core Scavvies are known to forgo classes, sleeping, and eating in pursuit of victory and eternal glory. For the rest of the student body, abnormal sleeping and eating patterns continue as per usual.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>Welcome to the quarter system. Each quarter is 10 weeks. The end of 10th week is reading period. Finals are technically 11th week. Your whole life for the next four years is going to be organized around whichever week it is in the quarter (first week, second week, third week, etc.). There is no scientific or empirical proof that certain weeks are universally more difficult, but that shouldn’t stop you from using the blanket excuse and/or gripe, “Ughh, X week.” We understand X week is always the hardest, even if last week was previously the hardest.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header text">Bar Night</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>Wednesday nights in the Alpha Delt basement. Buy drinks for less than $5, see random people from your Hum class, spend the rest of the night double-shampooing your hair to get rid of the smell of cigarettes. Ah, the sweet nostalgic stench of post-adolescence! <em>Overheard at Bar Night: “Was that my TA?”</em>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>Legend has it that Einstein Bros. Bagels could move into the Reynolds Club only on the condition that they sold $1 milkshakes each week, a tradition established in the prior coffee shop. Years of inflation later, there’s consistently a line of students stretching out the door every Wednesday—more commonly referred to as Shake Day. </p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>Ah yes, the Reg, the towering, brutalist library that serves as both a prison and a hub. Everyone goes to the Reg planning to study, and most, when asked, will claim to have been studying. But it’s a rare specimen that spends all day at the Reg (as you will hear endlessly) <em>actually studying</em>. And after repeatedly refreshing your Facebook and Twitter feeds and watching a couple YouTube clips, you really need to get a coffee to hunker down and bust through some pages. Hey, you spent all day at the Reg— you deserve it! See you tomorrow on the third floor!</p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>It happens to the best of us. You just wanted to sit in a comfortable chair for a few minutes to catch up on your reading. You know, to give your eyes a break from your laptop. You just took your shoes off because, hey, it’s eighth week (see: “Breaking down the quarter week by week”), and we’re all pretty cozy by eighth week.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>Still not pumped for winter? COUP is here to help! Second week of winter quarter is the weeklong festival Kuviasungnerk, which is named after the Inuit word for the pursuit of happiness. Every morning during Kuvia, students meet at 6 a.m. in Henry Crown Field House for Kangeiko, which is named after the tradition in karate to exercise during the coldest time of the year, but is in reality mostly yoga and dancing followed by bagels and regret. The last morning of Kangeiko concludes with a walk to the Point and a celebratory free T-shirt for everyone who made it out every morning. Free T-shirts validate all struggles in college.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header text">Stepping on the seal</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>At some point during the admissions tour, the tour guide stopped to show you the gold University seal on the ground at the entrance to Reynolds Club. Legend goes that if you step on the seal, you won’t graduate in four years. While it might seem annoying to avoid the seal at first, you’ll soon find yourself snickering at the hundreds of prospective students who step on the seal during their tours, dooming their fate at the University. Spoiler alert: The tradition was started by faculty who didn’t want students to wear away the engraving.</p>

            <li>
      <div class="collapsible-header text">Latke-Hamentaschen Debate</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>For one evening during each of the last 66 years, some of the University’s most brilliant faculty have come together to debate the universe’s fundamental question: Which is the superior food, the latke or the hamentaschen? Those who have debated the merits of the traditional Jewish potato pancakes and cookies have ranged from professors who went on to be top advisors to President Barack Obama to philosophers to biologists. <em>Overheard at the Latke-Hamentaschen debate: “True philosophy leads to the latke.”</em>

      <div class="collapsible-header text">Summer Breeze</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>After the ice melts, both on the ground and in your heart, the Summer Breeze festival kicks off. For one glorious afternoon, you can drink to excess on the quad, go see a concert put on by the Major Activities Board (MAB), and wonder if this is what it would feel like to go to a school without a Core and in a warmer climate. Last year, Azealia Banks headlined with supporting acts T-Pain and Madeon. Nelly, Crystal Castles, Nas, Spoon, Broken Social Scene, Run DMC, and U2 have played at the concert in the past.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-header text">Being Socially Awkward</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>If you’re walking across the quad and someone from class avoids eye contact with you, don’t take it personally. UChicago students may be able to do delta-epsilon proofs and understand complex price models, but small talk isn’t always their forte. Take any chance you can get to talk to new people. Even if it takes a little coaxing, they’re probably just as eager to talk to you. <em>Overheard being socially awkward: “Do you want another beer, or would you rather talk about the problem set?”</em>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>You knew about it when you applied here, and you knew about it when you decided to attend, but you won’t truly understand the Core until you’re up at 3 a.m. writing a Sosc paper on Durkheim, surviving on a sugar rush from Bart Mart gummy bears and Red Bull. The Core can be what you make of it; writing seminars can be an opportunity to work closely with your Hum TA, or to peer-edit the work of that cute classmate that sits across from you. Before it’s all over, you will have six classes in the humanities, six in math and sciences, and three in social sciences under your belt. Those courses, in addition to the language requirements, will teach you how to approach ideas that you completely don’t understand and how to casually drop Foucault and Freud into conversation. </p>

      <div class="collapsible-header text">T-shirt Slogans</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p class='text'>Houses often raise money for bonding events by selling T-shirts with the University logo on the front and a self-deprecating slogan on the back. Regularly sold during prospective student weekends, the shirts make parents think twice before sending their children to UChicago. Some of the most famous slogans are “Where fun goes to die,” “Hell does freeze over,” and “Where the only thing that goes down on you is your GPA.” But, as you’ll hear again and again, don’t take them seriously; the only thing the slogans reflect is the wit of the student body.

      <h4>While You Were Out</h4>
        <p class='article-author'>Eleanor Hyun</p>
        <p class='text'>It’s one thing to know the University of Chicago by the broad strokes of its reputation and brochures, quite another to know it as a community member experiencing the penciled-in fluctuations of each new year, not yet inked into the history books. But it turns out that the history of this University is written by the accumulation of that nitty-gritty. In the conversations and debates you will have and hear this coming year, you will likely encounter many references to the events of this past year. So, for your benefit, what follows is a summary of the major events and dialogues of 2014–2015; a year in the life at the University of Chicago.</p>
        <p class='text'>During O-Week last year, a Tumblr titled The Hyde Park List <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/09/23/hyde-park-list-accuses-students-of-sexual-violence/" target="_blank">accused six current and former male students</a> of sexual assault or harassment. The Tumblr was accompanied by flyers posted around campus. Within the week, a group claiming to be the UChicago Electronic Army (UEA) <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/09/24/hackers-accuse-student-of-creating-hyde-park-list/" target="_blank">hacked the website of MODA</a>, an on-campus fashion magazine, and publically accused a student of creating and distributing The Hyde Park List. The UEA had <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2013/11/15/freenters-hacking-exposes-lax-security-compromises-student-information/" target="_blank">hacked Freenters</a>, a free printing service on campus, a year before and leaked the passwords of the service’s users.</p>
        <p class='text'>This incident followed increased examination and criticism of the University’s handling of sexual assault over the past couple years, including a federal investigation for potential breaches of Title IX, a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. Since the investigation began, the University has revised its handling of sexual assault cases and is now in line with Title IX, although student activists point out that there is still progress to be made.</p>
        <p class='text'>Before fall quarter was over, the UEA would make another appearance as the alleged hackers of a student’s Facebook account, although the hack and UEA’s involvement would eventually be debunked. This incident occurred in the midst of <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/11/21/protests-against-racism-escalate-after-online-threats/" target="_blank">student activism surrounding racial insensitivity on campus</a>, set off by stereotypical costumes of Mexican gangsters worn on Halloween. Petitions penned by both students and faculty urged the University to address racial insensitivity on campus. In the midst of this, a post appeared on a student activist’s Facebook page that used racial slurs, threatened sexual assault, and targeted a specific student activist. The student initially claimed that his Facebook had been hacked by the UEA, but further investigation by the University found that <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/11/25/admin-student-confirm-fake-facebook-hack/" target="_blank">no hack had occurred</a> and the student himself posted the status. However, other student activists pointed out that, although the “hack” was staged, this did not detract from the original message calling for racial sensitivity and a culture of inclusion.</p>
        <p class='text'>After meetings with students, the <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/12/16/campus-awaits-climate-surveys-diversity-advisory-council/" target="_blank">administrators announced that they would convene a Diversity Advisory Council</a> consisting of both faculty of students, and would conduct two campus climate surveys to further examine the campus culture. The first of these surveys, focusing on the treatment of sexual assault and harassment on campus, collected responses from students in spring quarter, and its preliminary results <a href="https://csl.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/Climate_Survey_Spring_2015_preliminary_report.pdf" target="_blank">can be found online</a>, with the full report scheduled for release this autumn quarter. The second survey, focusing on the issues of diversity and inclusion, is to follow. Administrators have said that the results of the survey will be used to inform institutional action to address these issues.</p>
        <p class='text'>During these incidents, the president and provost of the University sent a campus-wide email reiterating the University’s commitment to diversity and condemning harassment and threats on the basis of a person’s identity. However, at the beginning of winter quarter the University’s Committee on Free Expression released <a href="https://provost.uchicago.edu/FOECommitteeReport.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> that almost unequivocally affirmed the University’s commitment to freedom of speech. Protection against a “genuine threat or harassment” was described as a “narrow exception to the general principle of freedom of expression.” Since the report’s release, other universities such as Purdue and Princeton have adopted similar policies. However, how the University reconciles its commitment to free speech with its commitment to inclusivity is still a matter of debate.</p>
        <p class='text'>Paralleling student activism surrounding racial insensitivity on campus were discussions among students and community members about <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/10/31/students-recount-racial-bias-of-ucpd/" target="_blank">racial profiling from the UCPD and the police force’s lack of accountability</a> to the community it polices. These groups pointed out that the UCPD’s status as a private police force meant that it had fewer legal obligations to be accountable to the community. The UCPD announced a Director of Professional Accountability in the fall and, in the spring, <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/04/14/ucpd-to-make-public-information-on-traffic-stops-field-stops-and-arrests/" target="_blank">announced that information</a> on traffic stops, field stops, and arrests would be made public in an effort to increase transparency with the community. Only a couple weeks after this announcement, <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/04/28/rally-for-ucpd-transparency-held-after-passage-of-hb-3932-in-the-illinois-house/" target="_blank">Illinois House Bill 3932 was passed</a>. The bill would hold the UCPD and other private campus police forces to release information similar to that required of public police forces. The bill must pass the Illinois Senate and receive Governor Bruce Rauner’s signature to become law. The UCPD has also <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/05/05/ucpd-to-create-advisory-board-drawing-from-local-community/" target="_blank">announced the creation of a Community Advisory Board</a>, which will help to connect the UCPD and non-University affiliated community members.</p>
        <p class='text'>In the fall, the University also announced the public phase of its fundraising campaign titled “Inquiry and Impact,” which will conclude in 2019. The fundraising goal for this campaign is $4.5 billion, with $150-200 million going to student financial aid. The University has already announced changes to its financial aid policy through a new initiative called <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2014/10/03/university-launches-no-loan-initiative/" target="_blank">“No Barriers,”</a> which included eliminating loans for need-based scholarships, waiving the application fee, and additional funding and support for low- and middle-income students. Additional donations led to <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/01/09/13-million-to-expand-no-barriers/" target="_blank">further expansion of the “No Barriers” program</a> in the winter, including further aid for international students. Student activists continue to advocate for a better college experience for low-income students.</p>
        <p class='text'>Along with this fundraising campaign, the University has also announced <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/04/27/provost-announces-new-administrative-cost-cutting-initiative/" target="_blank">a new administrative cost-cutting initiative</a>, stating that non-academic departments will be most affected by the cuts. Students, concerned that these cuts may result in the firing of mid-level and low-wage campus workers and higher costs to students, orchestrated a sit-in in Rosenwald Hall, the University’s admissions building in the spring. They protested the cuts and a general trend of increasing corporatization of education.</p>
        <p class='text'>After the slums of a cold winter, it’s common for spring quarter to bring a flurry of excitement and activity to campus. Last spring, student government (SG) elections were some of the most contested and controversial in recent memory, drawing the highest voter turnout in years. Names to recognize are those of your president (Tyler Kissinger) and vice presidents (Kenzo Esquivel and Alex Jung). Recent actions by SG include <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/02/12/u-pass-passes-to-next-phase/" target="_blank">bringing UPass to campus for the 2016-17 school year</a>, <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/04/17/sg-announces-student-leadership-stipend-program/" target="_blank">starting a program of financial stipends for student leadership</a>, and <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/05/15/new-sg-budget-increases-graduate-student-funding/" target="_blank">increasing budget allocation to graduate students</a>. Graduate students have increasingly spoken out against their rising student life fee, which has increased by 87.5% over the past ten years. SG’s increased support for graduate students will also be accompanied by the <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/05/28/uchicagograd-to-streamline-increase-grad-student-services/" target="_blank">University’s new UChicagoGRAD program</a>.</p>
        <p class='text'>In May, the Barack Obama Foundation announced that it had selected the University of Chicago’s bid for the <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/05/15/obama-foundation-officially-announces-south-side-library/" target="_blank">Barack Obama Presidential Center to come to the South Side</a>.</p>
        <p class='text'>And, as the year came to a close, the Trauma Center Coalition—which includes both student and community activists—led a series of protests for the University to build an adult Level 1 trauma center on the South Side. The protests included nine protesters barricading themselves in Levi Hall, the University’s administrative building. After police and firefighters broke through the wall of the building, the nine protesters were arrested. Another protest, which involved disrupting an alumni awards ceremony, ended with an alum assaulting some of the protestors and being arrested by the University police. Protests for a South Side trauma center have escalated over the past few years at the University of Chicago, and these often spark discussions both about healthcare on the South Side as well as how University treats protestors and their policies for protest on campus. These years of turmoil have led to progress though—as of September, the University has announced a joint project with the Mt. Sinai Medical System to <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/09/11/trauma-center-coming-to-south-side/" target="_blank">establish an adult Level 1 Trauma Center at Holy Cross Hospital on the South Side</a>.</p>
        <p class='text'>Looking towards the future—five dorms and their nine houses are now on their last legs. At the end of this year, <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/04/21/nine-houses-to-be-retired-after-opening-of-campus-north/" target="_blank">Blackstone, Breckenridge, Broadview, Maclean, New Grad will close</a>, with their houses being moved to the new North Campus Residence Hall. The final decision on this matter was announced suddenly and led to the student “Save our Satellites” movement, which protested the closure of the dorms, changing of house names, and lack of student involvement or input in the decision. The closure of these dorms follows the more sudden announcement and closure of Pierce dorm in 2013.</p>
