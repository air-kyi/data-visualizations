                    The debate over whether the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) should open an adult, level 1 trauma center has almost always been framed as community and student groups against the administration and business interests. It is nearly impossible to foster a discussion surrounding the issue without hearing the words “profit over people” voiced by some who believe UCMC has forgone a moral obligation to open a trauma center. Others will retort that UCMC simply does not have the funds to support such an endeavor as it already provides a substantial amount of care to underinsured, south side residents. While many are aware of the frequent protests and rising tensions, few are aware of the history of <a href=''>UCMC’s decision to close their adult trauma center</a> [this will be a hyperlink to Katherine Vega’s article] and the healthcare, financial and infrastructural circumstances surrounding the hospital and the south side. Furthermore, an investigation into why administrators and students/community members disagree has not been performed. In light of this, the Maroon embarked on a more in-depth investigation focused on south side health concerns, the sides of the debate, and what solutions people hope will make it to the table.

                    <h2 class='section-divider-heading'>The Health Probelms of the South Side</h2>
                </p>

                <p class='text body-text first-paragraph'>
                    So what are the most pressing health care issues that afflict the South Side? We directed this question to Associate Dean of Students, Dr. Jim Woodruff, during an in-person interview. Arriving to UCMC over 20 years ago, Dr. Woodruff is a general medicine physician and has worked primarily as a primary care doctor, and has spent time practicing medicine in surrounding south side areas, such as the community health clinic branch in Englewood.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    Issues such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and their sequelae, including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, were several among many diseases that Dr. Woodruff believes do not garner enough attention.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    “[These diseases] are associated with levels of disability and other measures of health that in many of the neighborhoods in the south side compare to third-world nations, yet, these are issues that are not talked about as frequently as they should be in the press” Woodruff said. “If we fail to have these conversations, then we can anticipate that those problems are simply not going to receive adequate attention”
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    Woodruff highlighted the importance of understanding that violence and trauma do pose significant burdens on the South Side. “As a primary care doctor, I am confronted with patients who have been victims of trauma and are often disabled because of their encounters” Woodruff said. However, they may not be the biggest killers hospitals like UCMC have to manage despite disproportionate press coverage. “In terms of the actual numbers of people affected by these issues, the burden of chronic medical disease far outweighs the issue of violent trauma here on the South Side of Chicago…but I don’t understand why pressing issues such as these chronic medical conditions don’t receive as much attention in the press.”
                </p>
                <hr class='no-margin-bottom'>
                <div class='quotation text'>“[pull quote]”</div>
                <hr class='no-margin-bottom'>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    4th year Pritzker Medical Student, and President of Medical Students for Health Equity (M-SHE), Abdullah Pratt, corroborated Dr. Woodruff’s assessment. Born and raised in the South Side, Pratt spent much of childhood in the Woodlawn area, which is directly south of Hyde Park, and is no stranger to the burden of violence. He has witnessed the death of many friends and his brother here in the South Side. “If you were to brand the South Side of Chicago, it would be ‘gun-violence and crime’” Pratt said. He believes that UCMC should eventually open an adult level 1 Trauma Center (T1), as the main hospitals which have perfected trauma treatment are within the county system and not in the South Side.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    Yet, he states that chronic care is still the surpassing medical priority the UCMC must sustain. Because many of Chicago’s lower income residents live in the South Side, conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, asthma, and heart attack are some of the first diseases that come to Pratt’s mind when we asked him what the most pressing medical concerns are. “I think the average person would say trauma because of the news.” Pratt said. “The dialysis center looks like a waiting line for free food in a depression. But, you don’t see ’55 year old man died from complications of kidney disease’ on the news”.
                </p>

                    Shiro Wachira, an organizer for Students for Health Equity (SHE) and 3rd year at the College, agrees that chronic care is a primary concern, but stated that it should not overshadow south side youth issues. She provided a different way of viewing the data, stating that violence in the South Side is particularly concentrated within youth demographics. This is something that could be missed if you look at mortality data without adjusting for age. “[Gun-shot violence] is the number one cause of death, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health, for people aged 18-24 on the south side” Wachira said.

                    However, she emphasized that, to her, data isn’t the only way one should justify the building of a trauma center. “We try not to have a data driven campaign, because I feel like that reinforces an ideology that we don’t believe in” Wachira said. “That you can justify life by number…you can’t justify the value of a trauma center by looking at a balance sheet.” She also insists that even if there are other urgent, healthcare needs which do not necessarily target South Side youth, it does not remove the need for youth-targeted care. The availability of a trauma center is a way, she believes, UCMC can more effectively address the unfortunate consequences of the overwhelming plague of assault among South Side youth.

                <p class='text body-text'>
                    We also reached out to Youth Organizer of FLY, Veronica Morris Moore, who was raised on the South Side. She has witnessed the burden of poverty, gang violence and drugs on South Side neighborhoods directly and says that, for many young black individuals, violence provides a source of income and avenue for the most basic of needs. “We don’t make that choice to grow up poor, to grow up around guns and drugs. And, we don’t have a whole lot of ability to change the circumstances” she says. “People feed their families off of drug money…if I take my little brother, for example, it was the way he put food in his mouth when my mom couldn’t. It was way he put shoes on his feet.”

                <p class='text body-text'>
                    She believes that UCMC, up to date, has not put in enough ground work to truly know whether it is financially feasible to support a trauma center. Though she agrees that while data may show that gun violence is not the biggest killer in general, she states that the disproportionate way in which it affects black youth in the South Side deserves recognition. “It needs to be seen as a health epidemic in relation to young black people” Moore said. “Those of us who come from these neighborhoods need to be taken into account…even more so over these numbers.” To her, the push for a Trauma Center and the utilization of direct action, are fueled by the collective feeling that the lives of black youth have been neglected. For their age, and smaller South Side constituency, they have not been taken seriously.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    “It’s not the fact that [violence] is killing off hundreds of people. It’s the people that it’s killing off, and that’s why it’s not important [to UCMC]” Moore said. “Are our lives not worth saving?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2 class='section-divider-heading'>Would a trauma center actually help?</h2>
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text first-paragraph'>
                    On August 15th, 2010, charismatic youth advocate and aspiring musician, Damian Turner, was gunned down in a drive-by shooting a mere four blocks from UCMC. Chicago Fire Department paramedics were required to drive him to the nearest Level 1 trauma center, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, on the northern edge of downtown. The unfortunate circumstances lead some to claim that, had UCMC been equipped with a T1, Mr. Turner would still be alive today.

                <p class='text body-text'>
                   The first hour after the onset of out-of-hospital traumatic injury is typically referred to as the “golden hour”, yet the relationship between transit-to-hospital time and mortality outcomes remains largely unclear. In March of 2010*[what do we do about study citations? Added in footer for reference], a nationwide study analyzed 3,656 trauma patients, ages 15 and up, and found that there was no association between transport time and in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, total emergency medical services (EMS) time, which includes activation of EMS, time-to-scene, and transport time still did not predict in-hospital death.

                    Since then, two studies in 2013* have reached conflicting conclusions. The first dissected trauma into two general categories: blunt and penetrating trauma. Gunshot wound (GSW) and stab victims fall under penetrating trauma. Utilizing a database of 19,167 trauma patients, they found that while trauma severity and the time a patient is at the scene of injury strongly correlated with penetrating trauma mortality, transport times did not.

                <p class='text body-text'>
                    A study done at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine by Marie Crandall disputes these former findings. Utilizing the Illinois State Trauma Registry (1999-2009), and restricting their study to 11,744 GSW patients, they found that when victims were shot more than 5 miles from Level I or II trauma centers, this correlated positively with mortality outcomes. 
                </p>
        <p class='text body-text'>
                    The Illinois Department of Public health reviewed Crandall’s study, and stated that although proximity to trauma centers (Adjusted Odds Ratio[AOR], 1.23) were found to have a positive effect on survival outcomes for gunshot wound (GSW) victims, injury severity (AOR = 8.06), lack of insurance (AOR = 2.27) and suicide intent (AOR = 8.76) were much more predictive of mortality. IDPH concluded that reducing mortality due to GSWs will require a strategy that improves mental health service access and addresses the disparity of health insurance. In their own discussion of the study outcomes, Crandall et al note that “modifications of trauma systems cannot address any of these issues”. 
                </p>
        <h2 class='section-divider-heading'>What do both sides want?</h2>
        <p class='text body-text first-paragraph'>
                    The Illinois Department of Public Health released the “Trauma Center Feasibility Study” this past January, which assessed the level of services currently in place at various hospitals within the City of Chicago, and surveyed each responding facility about their interest in pursuing a trauma level designation. Trauma levels are traditionally designated on a level of 1 to 5, though 1 through 3 were considered for this survey in light of the need to address penetrating injuries.

                    Using a feasibility cutoff of 60%, indicating that the facility in question already has 60% of available resources to sustain a particular trauma center level, IDPH found that UCMC was the only respondent that could sustain a Level 1, and one of two facilities that could sustain a Level 2 center. Yet when surveyed for their interest in acquiring a trauma level designation, UCMC indicated no interest despite having the highest readiness. Advocate Trinity, Jackson Park and Roseland, however, expressed high interest in acquiring a trauma level designation contrary to their poorer feasibility scores.

                    Since then, UCMC released a <a href='http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/trauma'>statement</a> in March detailing the administration’s current plans to tackle trauma in the South Side, while maintaining other vital services. They stated that they “remain open to working with state, city, county and other health care providers to evaluate the needs of the South Side and the long-term financial and operational realities of running an adult trauma center”, suggesting that a regional solution is on the table.

                    This statement followed a number of expansions by the hospital. This includes the expansion of the age of non-trauma patients in Comer Children’s Hospital’s pediatric emergency department from 15 to 17 years of age last summer. Most recently, UCMC announced that it is taking formals steps towards raising the age limit of Comer’s Level 1 pediatric trauma center from 15 to 17 years of age. Last year, Comer T1 cared for 260 children. When asked how the raising of the age would impact Comer services in a Q&A sent by the Maroon, UCMC forwarded the following reply.

                    “Medical center leaders have taken formal steps to raise the age limit of its pediatric trauma program to include 16- and 17-year-old children.  Comer Children’s Hospital will care for about 120 additional patients as a result of the age increase, which would be a roughly 40 percent increase.”
                </p>
        <p class='text body-text'>
                    Finally, UCMC leaders announced that a feasibility study, which began this past January, will assess the realities of opening a trauma center in the South Side.

        <p class='text body-text'>
                    When asked what she felt would be reasonable solutions to the current trauma desert, Moore emphasized that while T1 has been acquiring substantial press coverage, it isn’t the only possibility. “It doesn’t have to be a level 1 trauma center at the University of Chicago” Moore said. “I believe there needs to a network. So we can’t just be on the shoulders of the University. It has to be a support team…different levels, different agencies have to be a part of this”.
