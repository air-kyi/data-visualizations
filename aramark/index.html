                    The Life of the Mind has gone global in the last three decades, with international student presence doubling over thirty years to encompass one-fifth of the University’s overall student population. The College has also experienced a steady increase in multiculturalism, with the number of undergraduate international students growing tenfold since 1980, now coming to account for one in every 10 undergraduate students.

                    last four academic years, growing from 19.49% of the international student population in fall 2011 to 25.76% in fall 2014. The percentages of the three next most-represented countries, India (12.28% to 11.61%), Canada (6.58% to 6.27%), and South Korea (7.53% to 6.24%), all remained stable or declined over the same time period. Data for specific countries were obtained from official University censuses.

                <p class='text body-text'>“Now, the trend is that a lot of the ‘elite’ students from China are going to top-tier American universities. First of all, their families can afford that, and second, people are realizing that the quality of higher education in China is not quite satisfactory. Except for the top-tier schools in China…students’ lives are so laid-back and relaxed. They are not studying, and they cannot get much from their college experience. That’s why a lot of students are coming to the United States,” he added.</p>

                    Liu also noted that the University of Chicago’s recent rise in the U.S. News and World Report’s college rankings often influences the decision of Chinese students to attend the University.

                    Nikita Sachdeva, a fourth-year international student from India, indicated that the devaluation of Indian currency in recent years has made it more difficult for Indian students to study abroad. This may have contributed to the slight decrease in the percentage of international Indian students at UChicago.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>
                    “If you look at what’s happened in the past one and a half years, Indian currency has devalued. When I started school, one USD was equal to around 50 Indian rupees. Now, one USD is equal to 62 Indian rupees. For any parent who’s paying a part of the tuition, or the full tuition, it’s a big change. It’s a big jump in how much you have to pay in four years. I don’t think it’s become any easier at the economic or financial level for the Indian student.”

            <div class='chart chart-3 col-lg-offset-3 col-lg-4 col-md-offset-2 col-md-6 col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10 col-xs-12'>

            <div class='col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-md-offset-1 col-md-8 col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10 col-xs-12'>
                <p class='text body-text'>However, Sachdeva was quick to add that UChicago’s focus on India, exemplified by its new Center in New Delhi, has spurred interest from Indian students to study abroad at UChicago.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>“I think UChicago is actually one of the bigger reasons why there’s been an influx of Indian students. UChicago has been pretty invested in India--now they have a center in Delhi, which they opened last year—which is a big deal. Not many other big schools—your Ivy Leagues, your Stanford, MIT, have done that yet,” she said. “I think looking at India from a different perspective, UChicago’s really got that going for them. They see Indian students as a boon for the University, maybe. Maybe they come here, do well, and at the end of the day it reflects pretty well on UChicago.”</p>
                <p class='text body-text'>Sachdeva also indicated that criticisms of the Indian system of education, which tends to focus on memorization and rote learning, have also driven interest in American education.
                </p>
                <p class='text body-text'>“I do think there is a growing urge among Indian students—especially in the big cities, Mumbai, Delhi—to step outside and just explore a new system of education which is very different from the Indian system of education. There is a lot of criticism of the Indian system of education,” she said. “It’s more based on the sciences, it’s more based on learning than understanding. In my high school...you could get by just by rote learning.”
