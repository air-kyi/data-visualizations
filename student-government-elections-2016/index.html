I think it’ll be hard, given the composition of the board of trustees, taking a stance on that could have an impact on their business strategies. In a way, we are established by the Rockefellers, who used oil, but it’s a hard topic. It’s definitely one I’m very interested in, and I believe that the University of Chicago can send a clear message by taking a stance in divestment, but I’m not really sure about the overall effects, so that’s why it needs to be discussed inside the board of trustees. I’m really excited that the march on Friday got the attention it did, and we will meet with the board of trustees, and I think that’s really important, and we need that kind of dialogue.”</p>

But I do think there is much to be done in how students understand bias. We have had minor incidents inside the school, and we have engaged in discussions between students and the perceptions that we have are totally different. For international students, it’s especially hard, because first it’s not speaking in your own language, and then when you come from a different culture, how do you understand race, how do you understand gender roles, and it’s completely different, so I do think that there needs to be a super-huge push from the University as a whole to better engage the situation.”</p>
